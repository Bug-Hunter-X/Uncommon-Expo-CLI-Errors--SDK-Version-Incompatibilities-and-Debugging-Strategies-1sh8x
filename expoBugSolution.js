The solution involves careful version management. First, ensure your Expo SDK is updated:

```bash
expo upgrade
```

Then, examine your `package.json`.  Identify any libraries that might be causing the issue by checking their compatibility with your Expo SDK version. You might need to update these libraries to versions that are compatible or choose alternative libraries:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "expo": "^48.0.18",
    "react-native-uncompatible-library": "^1.0.0" //Example of a potentially problematic library
  }
}
```

Check the documentation for `react-native-uncompatible-library` (or the library you suspect) to see its compatibility requirements with different Expo SDK versions.   If an update is available, use `npm install` or `yarn add` to upgrade it.  If no compatible version exists, find a suitable replacement library. 

If the problem persists after updating libraries, examine the complete error messages carefully.  You might discover information about specific functionalities or native modules that are not supported. In such cases, you might need to adapt your application logic to work around those incompatibilities or consider using a more compatible approach.
