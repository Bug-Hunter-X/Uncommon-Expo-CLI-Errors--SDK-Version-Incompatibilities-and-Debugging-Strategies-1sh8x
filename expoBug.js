This error occurs when using the Expo CLI and attempting to run an app that uses a library or feature that isn't compatible with the current Expo SDK version.  The error message itself might not always be clear, and can manifest in various ways, including build failures or runtime crashes.  For example, you might see a cryptic error during the build process related to native modules or missing dependencies.  Another way it might present is a runtime crash when a specific feature is accessed, potentially within a third-party library.
