# Uncommon Expo CLI Errors: SDK Version Incompatibilities and Debugging Strategies

This repository demonstrates a common yet often cryptic issue in Expo CLI projects: errors arising from incompatibility between the installed packages and the Expo SDK version.  These errors can be difficult to diagnose because error messages may not be precise.

## Reproducing the Bug

The `expoBug.js` file contains code that might trigger an error depending on your Expo SDK version and installed packages.  Try running the app; you might encounter a build error or runtime crash.

## Solution

The `expoBugSolution.js` shows how to fix the problem by carefully checking Expo SDK version compatibility and adjusting package versions accordingly.  It emphasizes version management using `package.json` and the use of compatible libraries.

## Key Considerations

* **Expo SDK Version:** Keep your SDK version up-to-date.  Regular updates address compatibility and security issues.
* **Package Compatibility:** Refer to the documentation of every package to determine its compatibility with your Expo SDK version.
* **Version Management:** Use tools like `npm ls` or `yarn why` to analyze your dependency tree and identify potential conflicts. 
* **Alternative Libraries:**  If a library is incompatible, seek out alternatives that are actively maintained and compatible with your Expo version.
* **Error Messages:** Pay close attention to the full error message and stack trace. This information provides crucial hints in resolving the problem.  Consult online resources and forums for assistance with less common errors.
